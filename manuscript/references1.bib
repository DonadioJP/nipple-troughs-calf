	abstract = {Dairy calves are often housed in individual pens, which limits play behaviour. This study investigates whether the motivation for social play builds up during periods of deprivation hereof. Sixteen mixed-sex pairs of calves (33 ± 3 days of age) were housed in pair pens for 1 week and then separated into adjacent single pens. In each of two successive weeks, in a cross-over design, the pairs of calves were given access to an arena (3.6 m × 7.10 m) for 45 min on two consecutive days followed by deprivation of arena access for 4 days or 0 days before being tested on the seventh day. On test days, health was scored for all calves. The bull calf of each pair was chosen as focal calf. The behaviour of the focal calf was recorded during the 20-min test. When deprived of arena access for 4 days, calves performed more parallel locomotor play than when deprived for 0 days (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Calves performed more frontal pushing in the second week of the study (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Calves performed less frontal pushing (social play) (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) and tended to perform more individual locomotor play (P = 0.05) with increasing (worse) companion calf health score. The results suggest that the motivation for some, but not all, elements of calf play behaviour builds up over time. Thus, differentiating between elements of play may be important in the use of calf play behaviour to assess animal welfare. The association between the health of the companion calf and frontal pushing suggests that a healthier calf stimulates more social play.},

	abstract = {Social pair housing of calves has previously demonstrated positive impacts for calves, so this study aimed to compare the health and behaviour of calves kept in individual compared to pair housing on a single commercial UK dairy farm. A total of 457 Holstein and Jersey heifer calves were recruited and systematically allocated to individual and pair housing. Weekly visits were conducted up to 8 weeks of age, with weight and presence of clinical disease measured using both a standardized scoring system and thoracic ultrasonography. A subset of calves (n = 90) had accelerometers attached to monitor activity, with CCTV placed above a further 16 pens to allow behavioural assessments to be made via continuous focal sampling at 1 and 5 weeks of age. During the study, there was a mortality rate of 2.8\%, and an average daily liveweight gain (ADLG) of 0.72 kg/day, with no significant effect of housing group (p = 0.76). However, individually housed calves had increased odds of developing disease (OR = 1.88, p = 0.014). Accelerometer data showed that housing group had no effect on lying times, with a mean of 18 h 11 min per day (SD 39 min) spent lying down. The motion index was significantly higher in pair-housed calves (F1,83 = 440.3, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01), potentially due to more social play behaviour. The total time engaged in non-nutritive oral behaviours (NNOBs) was not impacted by housing group (p = 0.72). Pair-housed calves split their time conducting NNOBs equally between inanimate objects and on their pen mates’ body. Individually housed calves spent significantly more time with their head out of the front of the pen (p = 0.006), and also engaged in more self-grooming than pair-housed calves (p = 0.017), possibly due to a lack of socialization. The overall findings of this study indicate that within a UK commercial dairy management system, pair-housed calves were healthier and more active than individually housed calves, while housing group did not influence ADLG or the occurrence of NNOBs.},

	abstract = {Although the neonatal and infancy period is short, it is well documented that the early neonatal environment is critical for appropriate physical, behavioral, and cognitive development that lasts into adulthood. Dairy calves are commonly removed from the dam shortly after birth and raised in individual housing and fed limited milk allowances (4 to 6 L/d) in commercial farms around the world (conventional raising). Individual housing was developed to promote health status and facilitate individual animal monitoring. However, it is associated with high labor demand, and early life social isolation is associated with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. Recently, group housing and enhanced milk-feeding programs are being increasingly adopted by farms; these practices more closely resemble the social and nutritional environments in natural or seminatural environments when the calf is raised with the dam. Conventional raising may lead to short- and long-term effects when compared to calves raised with the dam or peers. Short-term effects of conventional raising include impaired social skills when introduced to novel peers, reduced consumption of novel feeds, increased activity in a novel environment, and signs of hunger associated with limited milk intake and poor growth during the preweaning period. Evidence also suggests that the long-term effects of conventional artificial raising systems include behavioral differences, such as lower social submissiveness, increased heart rate and cortisol when presented with a novel environment, and production differences such as milk yield and reproductive performance. However, research on the long-term effects of maternal, social, physical, and nutritional restrictions in early life is still limited and should be encouraged. More research is needed to determine the long-term effects of artificial raising systems (individual, group housing, dam-raised) on future behavior, cognition, performance, and health parameters in dairy calves.},

	abstract = {Most dairy calves are housed individually in the first weeks and sometimes months of their lives. Lack of social interaction can negatively impact feed intake, social skills, coping abilities, and cognitive performance, but the motivation of calves to seek companionship has seldom been investigated. In this study, 10 Holstein bull calves (Bos taurus; averaging 5.4 ± 2.6 d old upon entering the study) were housed individually in a central home pen with access to one pen on either side, each connected by a push gate. One side pen housed another calf of similar age and the same sex, and the second was otherwise identical in size and resources (feed and water) but without a social companion. Each time the test calf pushed open the gate to access a side pen, he would be left in it until the next feeding (approximately 0800 and 1600 h), at which time he was returned to the central home pen. After each successful pushing event, additional weight was added to the gate (initially a small amount, then incrementally higher). All calves but one pushed for the first time on d 1 of enrollment (within 9.4 ± 14.8 min of experimental start); the remaining calf pushed on d 3 of the test. Each calf was tested for 15 d and we recorded the maximum weight pushed for both side pens. Calves pushed a higher maximum weight (and pushed more frequently) for access to the pen with a social partner compared with the empty pen. We conclude that calves are socially motivated, even at a young age, and that calves can benefit from access to social contact.},

	abstract = {Background The aim of this study was to investigate if calves' play behaviour and non-nutritive sucking behaviour, as indirect measures of welfare status, are associated with the age of the calf when group housed, age when observed, age difference within the group, pen size, milk feeding system, current or previous sicknesses, access to dry teat, indoor/outdoor rearing, sex, organic/conventional farm, group size and regrouping events. An observational study was conducted on 176 Danish dairy calves in the age range of 1-12 weeks, on both conventional (n = 17) and organic (n = 5) farms. All calves had been group housed before 8 weeks of age and had spent various periods of time with the dam and/or individually housed before being group housed. Behaviour was recorded continuously by filming each individual calf over a period of 30 min. Results The calf's age when group housed for the first time was not found to be significantly associated with duration of either play behaviour (P = 0.55) or non-nutritive sucking behaviour (P = 0.44). It was found that calves had significantly reduced odds of playing for longer than the mean play duration (5.5 s) for each day of their lives (OR = 0.97, P = 0.003). Also, they had reduced odds of performing non-nutritive sucking behaviour for longer than the mean non-nutritive sucking duration (145.5 s) when milk was allocated by drinker buckets fitted with a teat compared to by bowl or trough (OR = 0.06, P = 0.02). Conclusion No significant associations were found between calves' age when group housed for the first time and play and non-nutritive sucking behaviour. It was found that calves' play behaviour decreased with increasing age, and that non-nutritive sucking behaviour decreased when milk was allocated with a teat compared to no teat.},

	abstract = {Since survival of the young mammals depends on sucking success, it is assumed that sucking motivation must be strong and that sucking deprivation would result in frustration which could have a negative impact on their welfare. This concern as well as that regarding cross-sucking between calves and intersucking between older animals has stimulated research on the motivation of calves for non-nutritive sucking. Non-nutritive sucking is elicited by the ingestion of milk, and the lactose concentration in milk, rather than that of fat or protein, is the main factor stimulating non-nutritive sucking. Every time a calf drinks milk, it is stimulated to suck and deprivation of sucking may interfere with digestive processes or satiety. To understand the behaviour of the calf during nutritive sucking, we examined the effects of milk flow on calves' sucking and butting an artificial feeding system. Slowing and stopping the flow rate stimulates butting and can lengthen the duration of sucking for the meal. It also stimulates the calf to switch teats when a second teat is available. These findings are well correlated to our observations of the calf suckling a cow in experimental manipulations. The duration of the meal is not correlated with milk intake, but it is influenced by milk availability and how hungry the calf is. Furthermore, calves will butt more often when there is less milk available in the dam's udder, presumably because milk flow is slower. Consequently, it is the occurrence of butting rather than sucking duration that would be a good indicator of milk intake when the calf is suckling the dam. Finally, we recommend a combination of slower milk flow and hay feeding and the provision of a non-nutritive artificial teat to reduce the occurrence of cross-sucking following a milk meal.

	abstract = {Group housing of calves is an animal-friendly natural and economic way of raising calves. One major disadvantage of artificial milk feeding in group housing systems, however, is the incidence of cross-sucking. The main objective of this study was the evaluation of structural and technical modifications of the feeding stall of an automatic teat feeder and the environmentally enriched feeding area in relation to a reduction of cross-sucking after finishing a milk meal. The experiment was carried out with 168 female calves (German Holstein) of one origin randomly assigned to two treatments: control group and optimized group with a furnished post feeding area and an exercise yard with environmental enrichment. Calves were fed by an automatic teat feeder according to schedule starting with 7 L whole milk per day and calf. Cross-sucking and general behaviour was observed for 20 min directly after the milk meal. Observations were made at three age levels on two consecutive days. Depending on the age group, cross-sucking behaviour of calves in the optimized group was significantly lower (11.9 to 17.2\%) compared to the control group (58.6 to 73.7\%). Based on the age, mean duration of cross sucking bouts showed in the control group were significantly higher (79.0 to 122.5 s) than the bouts of the optimized group (39.0 to 65.0 s). With an increase of age the calves of the optimized group used the post-feeding area first with an average duration of 129.0 s and later with an average duration of 416.0 s. Corresponding to this result, calves of the optimized group left the feeding stall significantly faster (13 s) than the reference group (61 s). Despite those facts, the presence of a post feeding area and its interior had no significant effect on feeding behaviour regarding concentrates and hay and other behaviour observed in relation to the milk meal. Our results indicated that adding a post feeding area to an automatic milk feeding system can significantly reduce cross-sucking of group housed calves related to milk intake by simultaneously increased performance of the feeder. However, future research is needed to evaluate interactions between feeding techniques, environment and physiological processes related to cross-sucking behaviour of calves. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Dairy calves in North America traditionally are housed individually and fed by manual milk feeding (MMF) systems with buckets or bottles. Automated milk feeders (AMF) allow for more natural milk feeding frequencies and volumes, and calves are usually housed in groups. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the prevalence of various milk-fed calf management and feeding practices and (2) compare these practices between dairy farms using MMF and AMF systems. A national online survey was performed from January to May 2015 to quantify management practices for the care of milk-fed dairy calves in Canada. A total of 670 responses were received (6\% of all dairy farms in Canada). Among respondents, 16\% used AMF and 84\% used A/IMF. Seventy percent of the farms using AMF had freestall barns compared with only 48\% of those using MMF. A greater. proportion of AMF farms (30\%) also had automatic milking systems (AMS) compared with MMF farms (8\%). Among tiestall farms, a herd size of {\textbackslash}textgreater 80 milking cows was associated with having an AMF [odds ratio (OR) = 3.8; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-11.4]. For freestall or bedded-pack farms, a herd size of {\textbackslash}textgreater 80 milking cows (OR = 3.5; 95\% CI: 1.8-6.6), having an ANIS (OR = 3.1; 95\% CI: 1.6-5.7), and use of cow brushes (OR = 3.1; 95\% CI: 1.3-6.9) were associated with having an AMF. Calves fed with ANIS typically were housed in groups of 10 to 15, whereas almost 76\% of the farms with MMF housed calves individually. Although both AMF and MMF farms fed similar amounts of milk in the first week of life (median = 6 L/d), the cumulative volume fed in the first 4 wk differed significantly, with a median of 231 versus 182 L for AMF and MMF, respectively. Median peak milk allowance was higher for AMF than for MMF (10 vs. 8 L/d, respectively). In summary, farms using AMF were larger, provided more milk to calves, and used more automation in general (i.e., in other areas of their operation). These data provide insights into calf-rearing practices across Canada and into how the use of AMF is affecting calf feeding and management on dairy farms.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the effects of social housing, the provision of physical enrichment, and the interaction between the two on calf growth, behaviour and fearfulness. Forty-eight calves were randomly allocated to either individual (IP, sixteen calves) or pair (PP, thirty-two calves) pens from 2 days to 8 weeks of age. Half of the calves in each housing treatment were provided with physical enrichment items (stationary brushes, plastic chains, rubber teats and haynets filled with strawberry-scented hay; PE). The remaining calves received no physical enrichment items (NPE). Concentrate consumption within each pen was measured daily and calves were weighed at birth and weekly thereafter. Concentrate feeding efficiency was then calculated by the ratio between average daily gain within each pen and daily concentrate consumption within each pen. When calves were 2?5 weeks of age, they were recorded by a camera between 06:00 h and 20:00 h twice weekly, and behavioural data were collected using instantaneous scan sampling at 5-min intervals. Their behavioural responses to a novel environment and a novel object were then assessed once each at 5 or 6 weeks of age. PE calves tended to have greater average daily gains than NPE calves (mean ? IQR; 610.6 ? 151.8 g/d vs. 568.8 ? 77.1 g/ d; p = 0.095). PE calves spent more time consuming hay than NPE calves. Among calves in IP pens, PE calves consumed less concentrate but had better concentrate feeding efficiency than NPE calves. For home pen behaviours, PE calves showed less frequent non-nutritive sucking than NPE calves (0.802 ? 0.451 \% vs. 1.897 ? 0.401 \% of scans) and less frequent cross-sucking. Furthermore, PP increased or tended to increase the time spent on locomotor play, fixture sniffing, social sniffing, allogrooming and cross-sucking, but tended to decrease nonnutritive sucking compared to IP. No treatment effects were found on behaviour in the novelty tests. In conclusion, physical enrichment may improve calf growth more effectively than social housing does. Physical enrichment and social housing may satisfy diverse natural behaviours and reduce undesirable behaviour in different ways. However, these treatments had no effect on calf fear responses in novel environment and object tests. The combination of physical enrichment and social housing showed no further improvement in calf welfare.},

In total 16 calves of Swedish Red and White cattle housed in pairs were used. The eight groups were given 2.5l of whole milk per calf, twice a day in one of the following treatments; bucket with fast flow (control), bucket with slow flow, floating nipple with fast flow and floating nipple with slow flow. All groups were subjected to the four different treatments in a random balanced order. Two buckets were connected with a rubber pipe in order to control the milk flow. In the fast treatments, the milk poured from one bucket to the other in 40s, and in the slow treatments the milk poured from one bucket to the other in 10min. Each group had the treatment for 6 days before behavioural observations were done on day 7. These were made by instantaneous recordings at 20s intervals for 30min, starting when the calves received their milk in the morning and afternoon.

The lowest recording of abnormal sucking was found, when the calves had both a floating nipple and a slow flow. Sucking on other objects in the pen had the highest number of recordings, when they had a nipple and a fast flow (P{\textbackslash}textless0.01), but the sucking on the empty nipple represented 95\% of this category. The calves tended to lick and bite more on the bucket, the nipple and pen fittings in the two treatments with fast flow (P{\textbackslash}textless0.1) than in the slow treatment with nipple. It is concluded that both the performance of sucking and the time taken to ingest milk are important in order to decrease abnormal sucking between calves.},

The study was conducted on 90 calves from 5th to 90th day of age; all calves were fed the same feed and according to the same schedule. Results revealed that during the first month, the calves from both groups achieved the same daily gains. However, older calves kept indoor were characterised by better daily gains, feed intake and as a result, body weight. The outdoor system has positive effect on morbidity, especially in case of pneumonia and diarrhoea. During the experiment, only two calves were lost ( mortality rate - 2.2\%).},

	abstract = {Pair housing of dairy heifer calves during the preweaning period helps meet the natural social needs of the calf and has been shown to improve growth and starter intake during the preweaning period as compared with individual housing. However, there is little evidence to suggest that pair-housed calves maintain their social and growth advantages past the weaning phase. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of pair housing on measures of calf performance, health, and behavior up to 16 wk of age. Healthy Holstein and crossbred heifer calves were enrolled in the study after colostrum feeding, with the first calf randomly assigned to 1 of 2 housing treatments: pair (PR; 2 hutches with common outdoor space) or individual (INDV; 1 hutch plus outdoor space). All calves were bucket fed 4 L of milk replacer twice daily and weaned at 50 d of age. Weaned calves (6/group) remained with their treatment group until exit from the study at 16 wk. A venous blood sample was collected from each calf between 24 h and 7 d of age to test for serum total protein (g/dL). Body weights (kg) were obtained at birth, weaning, and 16 wk. Each enrolled calf was scored for health each week and calf health treatments were also collected. A hair sample was collected from the left shoulder at birth and 16 wk to assess hair cortisol (pg/mL). At enrollment, each calf was fitted with a triaxial accelerometer on the left hind leg for continuous recording of standing and lying time (min/24 h) for 16 wk. Latency to find feed, water, and lie down (min) at entrance to the weaned pen were recorded by continuous video observation. Open field testing with a novel object was performed at 5, 10, and 16 wk. Behaviors analyzed by video observation included latency to approach the object (s), vocalizations (n), and time spent immobile, walking, or running (s/10 min). Linear mixed models were used to determine the effect of treatment (INDV or PR) on calf growth, activity, and behavioral outcomes, which accounted for time, breed, the interaction of time and treatment, the random pen, and variability in testing day and repeated measurements within calf when appropriate. Twenty-four Holstein and crossbred calves (PR: n = 12, 6 pairs; INDV: n = 12) were enrolled from November 2 to December 23, 2018. The PR calves were 7.1 kg heavier at weaning and gained 0.15 kg/d more during the preweaning period as compared with INDV calves. In the 24 h after movement to the postweaning pen, PR calves lay down for longer periods of time (14.3 vs. 11.0 ± 0.4 h/d), and PR calves urinated more during novel object testing at 5 wk of age. Our study demonstrated benefits, such as better growth and increased lying time, of pair housing calves during the preweaning period.},

	abstract = {A longitudinal cohort study was conducted to follow the health of 787 calves from one UK dairy farm over a two‐and‐a‐half‐year period. Weekly health scores were gathered using a modified version of the Wisconsin Calf Scoring system (which did not record ear position) until calves were eight weeks of age, combined with data on colostral passive transfer, mortality, age at first conception and 305‐day milk yield. High morbidity levels were detected, with 87 per cent of calves experiencing at least one clinically significant event (diarrhoea, pyrexia, pneumonia, nasal or ocular discharge, navel ill or joint ill). High rectal temperature, diarrhoea and a cough were the most prevalent findings. The effect of total protein levels was significantly associated with the development of pyrexia as a preweaning calf (P{\textbackslash}textless0.01), but no other clinical health scores. The majority of moribund calves had just one clinically severe clinical sign detected at each of the weekly recordings. The overall mortality rate was 21.5 per cent up to 14 months of age, with 12.7 per cent of calves dying during the preweaning period. However, most calves that died were not recorded as having experienced a severe clinical sign in the time between birth and death, indicating a limitation in weekly calf scoring in detecting acute disease leading to death. Therefore, more frequent calf scoring or use of technology for continuous calf monitoring on farms is required to reduce mortality on farms with high disease incidence rates.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the effect of group size on the behaviour, heart rate, immunity, and growth of Holstein calves. A total of 132 calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments from birth to 46 days of age. These included single housed (S) or group housed with three (G3), six (G6), or twelve calves (G12) with six replicates for each. Behavioural responses were observed at 15, 30, and 45 days of age, and then physiological activities, including heart rate (HR) and saliva secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) levels, were measured. The serum immune indices of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and growth were measured at 16, 31, and 46 days of age. Group-housed calves exhibited significantly increased self-grooming, allogrooming, locomotive play, social play, exploration, standing, and walking behaviours and decreased lying behaviour (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). In contrast, S calves exhibited increased tongue-rolling behaviour than group-housed calves (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). However, there was no significant HR difference among the treatments, except for G12 calves at 15 days of age, which yielded the highest HR (118.13 ± 10.73 times/min; P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) level. Levels of saliva secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) were highest in G12 calves (28.69 ± 1.58 ng/mL), which first decreased and then considerably increased as the S calves (27.41 ± 1.09, 20.60 ± 1.36, and 26.79 ± 1.31 ng/mL; P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) increased in age. Concentrations of serum IL-2, IL-6, and TNT-α in the group-housed calves were higher than those in the S group (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Body weight (BW) in G12 calves was lower than that of other groups (57.25 ± 1.50 kg; P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). S calves displayed lower voluntary solid feed intake (VFI) and higher body length (BL) than grouped calves (2.02 ± 0.20 kg, 84.32 ± 0.83 cm; P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). The withers height (WH) was higher in S and G3 calves than G6 and G12 calves at 46 days of age (90.23 ± 2.21, 89.65 ± 2.18 cm vs 87.88 ± 1.59, 87.25 ± 1.53 cm; P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Taken together, our study suggests that before weaning, group-housed calves exhibit more natural behaviours, higher levels of immunity, and solid feed intake than solitary calves.},

Although there was no difference in grazing behaviour when housed in groups, calves spent longer eating concentrate, ruminating and drinking water. Additionaly, calves housed individually spend part of their time trying to get close to a neighbouring calf. When available, the brush was the physical enrichment item most used by calves followed by straw-man and ball. Pasture access may allow calves to exhibit their highly motivated natural behaviours such as grazing and rumination. Furthermore, social housing provides dairy calves an opportunity for social bonding. Thus, social housing with free access to pasture areas could be an alternative in tropical regions to the typical individual rearing system used in intensive dairy farming.},

	abstract = {To examine the effects of milk allowance and weaning age on cross-sucking, 45 dairy calves were housed in groups of nine and fed milk and grain-based starter feed from automated feeders and allocated to three treatment groups: (A) Low-Milk Early-Weaned (fed 6L/d of milk until weaned at 47 d of age), (B) High-Milk Early-Weaned (fed 12L/d of milk until weaned at 47 d of age), (C) High-Milk Later-Weaned (fed 12L/d of milk until weaned at 89 d of age). We observed all instances of cross-sucking another calf during 12h/d over 18 d between wk 5 and wk 21. When all calves were drinking milk, little cross-sucking occurred and was not related to milk allowance (P{\textbackslash}textgreater0.10). There was no significant change in the duration of cross-sucking when calves were weaned at either age (P{\textbackslash}textgreater0.10). There were large differences between individual calves in the duration of cross-sucking performed and these were stable over time, with positive correlations between the duration of cross-sucking in consecutive weekly periods (0.33{\textbackslash}textlessr{\textbackslash}textless0.57; P{\textbackslash}textless0.05). When the calves were moved to a second barn for weaned animals, most calves stopped cross-sucking but some calves increased their duration of cross-sucking. These calves performed much of their cross-sucking (43.6–99.1\%) on a single calf, and the cross-sucking was often mutual with both calves sucking each other at the same time. Cross-sucking was not strongly affected by milk allowance or weaning and may reflect characteristics of individual calves or be the result of habit formation.},

	abstract = {Context. Dairy calves are often separated from their dams following birth, despite the beneﬁcial effects of early life adult contact on behavioural development across species. Cow–calf contact systems are rare and often difﬁcult to implement in the modern dairy industry. The development of alternative systems offering some of the beneﬁts of adult social contact during early life, such as contact with non-maternal adults, has been limited. Aims. This study explored the behavioural patterns of grouped pre-weaned calves reared with or without non-maternal adult contact, and is the ﬁrst in a series of studies following the social and behavioural development of experimental calves from the age of 2 weeks to 2 years. Methods. Four groups of 10 calves housed at pasture were studied from 2 to 12 weeks of age. Two groups were housed with three non-maternal dry cows each (+S). Calf behaviour in these groups was compared with that of calves in the remaining two groups, housed without adult contact (−S). Observations were conducted on behaviours including grazing, locomotion and lying, using 5-min scan sampling between morning (0930 hours) and afternoon (1600 hours) milk-feeding on 1 day every second week of the experiment (x¯ = 5.9 h of data ± 0.4 h/group.day). Key results. Few behavioural differences were found between groups. All groups performed mostly lying behaviour in the middle of the day and spent the most time grazing in the afternoon before the evening milk feed. Conclusions. Our results indicated that calves housed at pasture behave according to innate diurnal patterns previously observed in studies of calves housed with the dam, and choose to spend the majority of daylight hours lying or grazing. Being housed with non-maternal adults has few effects on these observed behavioural patterns. Implications. Our study suggests that non-maternal adult contact does not affect the immediate behavioural development of calves housed at pasture. Future research needs to explore longitudinal effects of this contact.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT A trial compared the voluntary water intake of 72 purchased British Friesian bull calves fed at different nutrient intake levels by varying the type and strength of the milk replacer given to 5 weeks of age. There was no control group without water on offer. Water was offered from the 1st day the animals entered the unit. All calves received 4 1/day of either cows' milk (12 calves), milk replacer with 100 g fat per kg (24 calves), milk replacer with 170 g fat per kg (24 calves) or milk replacer with 200 g fat per kg (12 calves). Standard early-weaning pellets containing 190 g crude protein per kg and hay ad libitum were on offer from the 2nd day on the unit. Results indicated that voluntary intakes of water were highest with calves fed on cows' milk and lowest on the milk replacer with 100 g fat per kg given at the lowest mixing strength, although differences were only significant in week 5 ( P ≤ 0·05). By covariance analysis, the effects of water intakes on live-weight gain and on pellet intake were examined. The regression coefficient of live-weight gain (weeks 0 to 5) (kg) on water intake (weeks 1 to 5) (1) was b = 0·056 (s.e. 0·021, P ≤ 0·01). The regression coefficient of pellet intake (weeks 0 to 5) (kg) on water consumption was: b = 0·082 (s.e. 0·031, P ≤ 0·01). There was thus a significant correlation of both live-weight gain and pellet intake with water intake. For each extra litre of water consumed per day, there was an extra pellet intake of 0·082 kg and an increase in live-weight gain of 0·056 kg. There was a significant difference in total water intake according to the initial live weight of the calf.},

The rumen is an ideal microbial habitat because the conditions that exist are conducive for the survival and growth of microorganisms. The temperature remains relatively constant (36–40°). Water the animal drinks and the only exocrine secretion that rumen receives, saliva, provide a moist environment required for microbial growth. Ingested food provides the energy and other nutrients needed for microbial growth and activity. Normal reticulo-ruminal motility (peristalsis and antiperistalsis) helps mix the contents, which brings microbes into contact with fresh substrate. The end products of fermentation are removed by absorption (acids) into the blood or eructation (gases). Absorption coupled with the buffering effect provided by salivary secretions help regulate ruminal pH.},

The objective of this review article was to describe how environmental changes and challenges influence the health and behavior of young calves. Natural behavior, health, and welfare of the calves may be affected when they are reared indoors apart from their dams with another mate. Fresh perspectives on calf nourishment strategies (e.g., intensified vs. conventional milk feeding, and forage feeding) and housing (group or pair vs. individual) have been developed to assimilate the natural environment of calves. In recent years, based on scientific evidence a positive relationship between early-life calf health and later performance of dairy heifers has been indicated. Chronic exposure to stressors may lead to chronic inflammation, resulting in increased infectious disease and suppressed animal performance. Therefore, an effective diagnostic tool for the identification and prediction of the health status and welfare of calves would be to monitor the behavior of calves regularly on the farm. The main factors affecting the behavior of calves and their subsequent productivity are, nutrition and feeding programs, ambient temperatures, incidences of diseases as well as housing systems. Genetics can affect calf response to environmental alterations. In general, it alleviates stress and improves herd profitability and sustainability for producers and farmers by understanding the calves' behavior in response to environmental challenges.},

	abstract = {Abstract Having a successful heifer raising operation is not only relevant financially, but also influential for the future of the dairy herds. Milk feeding has a significant role on the health and growth of calves before weaning, in addition to the direct progressive effects on future performance post-weaning. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of constants amount of milk (CMS) versus step-up/step-down (SUSD) on calf performance in two different suckling schedules of suckling milk gradually till 9th weeks of calf age, then decreasing it till weaning. For this study, forty Holstein heifers calves utilized between birth and 8 months of age were randomly divided into four groups of 10 calves each. Grouping was performed according to suckling protocol (constant versus variable) and suckling schedule (2 versus 3 times/day). Each calf suckled 600 kg of milk in a suckling period of 120 days. Body weight (BW), in addition to five body measurements: chest girth (CG), height at wither (HW), height at rump (HR), body length (BL), and diagonal length (DL), were recorded weekly. The heaviest BW was observed on SUSD calves suckling twice/day which had also the highest HW at weaning. Similarly, were BW, HW, and CG at 6 months of age. Also, the same group achieved the largest daily BW (0.902 kg/day), BL (0.246 cm), and CG (0.338 cm/day) gains during the pre-weaning phase. However, CMS suckled 3 times/day calves had the largest daily BW gain between birth and 6 or 8 months of age. CMS twice/day calves had the largest daily gain in CG from weaning to 6 months and from weaning to 8 months of age followed by SUSD suckling 3 times/day calves. Also, CMS twice/day calves had the largest daily gain in rump height from birth to 8 months of age compared to other groups. It can be concluded that when equal amounts of milk were fed during the suckling period, suckling protocol affected growth rate before weaning but that effect diminished as calf age increased after weaning.},

Effects of feeding liquid milk-substitute to young calves either by nipple-pail or open-bucket on the rumen by-pass and on the rate of passage were studied.2.Sixteen Holstein calves, aged 1 week initially, were used in three experiments in which calves were slaughtered after they were given liquids (milk-substitute and water) containing chromic oxide and SrCl2 6H2O as a tracer either by the nipple- or bucket-feeding method, and the distribution of tracers to the rumen, abomasum and the lower alimentary tracts was examined.3.When the liquid milk-substitute containing tracers was given by the nipple- or bucket-feeding method to calves having been trained to the corresponding procedures for the preceding 1 week, most of the tracers was directed into the omasum and abomasum. There seemed no difference in the functioning of oesophageal groove closure between the two feeding procedures. Even when the liquid milk-substitute containing tracers was given by the nipple-or bucket-feeding method to calves which had been accustomed to different procedures for the preceding week, the majority of tracers were found in the abomasum immediately after administration, though a slightly greater proportion of the tracers entered the reticulo-rumen.4.Continuing bucket feeding of liquid milk-substitute effected an efficient closure of the oesophageal groove at least up to 16 weeks of age. After calves were accustomed to consume liquid milk-substitute from the bucket from 1 to 4 weeks of age, drinking warm water from the bucket also caused efficient closure at least up to 16 weeks of age.When tracers were administered with warm water, Cr2O3 and strontium, especially the latter, transferred much more rapidly to the lower gut than when they were administered with liquid milk-substitute, probably reflecting the curd formation of the milk-substitute in the abomasum. When liquid milk-substitute with tracers was fed by the bucket-feeding method, Sr transferred more rapidly to the lower gut than when the milk-substitute was fed by the nipple-feeding method, indicating that the feeding procedure of liquid milk-substitute has an apparent effect on the rate of passage.},

On d 1, after metabolic and endocrine 12‐h profiles were studied, RD and one control calf were fed for 10 d by nipple, whereas the other control calf was fed by bucket. On d 11, metabolic and endocrine 12‐h profiles were again studied. On d 1, mean plasma concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, urea, insulin, insulin‐like growth factor‐1 (IGF‐1), 3,5,3′‐triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and leptin were significantly different between RD and controls, whereas mean concentrations of non‐esterified fatty acids (NEFA), total protein, albumin, and glucagon did not differ significantly among groups. In RD concentrations of glucose, NEFA, insulin, growth hormone, IGF‐1, and T4 were higher, and of urea were lower on d 11 than on d 1. Glucose and insulin concentrations increased postprandially in healthy calves on d 1, but barely in RD and remained lower than in controls, and there was no rise of NEFA and triglyceride concentrations on d 1 after the initial postprandial decrease in RD, in contrast to controls. But on d 11 postprandial responses of these four traits were similar in RD and controls and urea and T4 concentrations on d 11 became normalized. However, glucose and T3 concentrations in RD on d 11 were still lower than in one or both control groups. In conclusion, various metabolic and endocrine traits in RD differed from healthy controls. Drinking by floating nipple instead of drinking from bucket for 10 d normalized several metabolic and endocrine traits in RD.},

	abstract = {In EU organic dairy farming, group housing of calves is required after the first week. Especially in Simmental herds, this is perceived as a risk factor for cross-sucking (CS), i.e. sucking the udder-region or the scrotal area or any other body part of another calf, which may reflect frustrated motivation, lead e.g. to umbilical infections or be continued after weaning. Therefore, this study aimed at identifying factors associated with cross-sucking to provide farmers with effective preventive measures and to investigate potential relations of cross-sucking with treatment incidences. During one-day visits data were collected by the same observer on 31 organic dairy farms with Simmental cattle. The visits included 90 min of direct continuous behaviour observation starting at the morning milk meal, semi-structured interviews and analysis of treatment records (available from n = 25 farms). The average herd size was 31 ± 10 cows (range: 17–59) and 11 ± 7 calves (range: 3–37) with a mean of 4 ± 2 calves per group (range: 2–8). Potential risk factors were screened using univariable analyses or Spearman rank correlation (inclusion threshold P {\textbackslash}textless 0.2). General linear models with backward selection of factors were applied for final modelling. Associations between behaviour and health data were identified using Spearman rank correlation. CS was observed on 29 farms (94\%) at a median rate of 1.66 (Q1 = 0.70, Q3 = 3.00) events/calf*hour. CS (explained variation 61.3\%, Intercept = 2.75) decreased when age was similar within group (estimate=−2.40, p = 0.001) and increased when calves were not restrained during the milk meal (as compared with restraint for {\textbackslash}textgreater 30 min; 1.46, p = 0.026). It was shown less frequently when use of nose-clips was not reported as a countermeasure (−2.22, p = 0.008). Duration of sucking at teat buckets was negatively correlated with CS (−0.23, p = 0.018) and the age at grouping had no significant effect on its occurrence. There were no significant correlations of cross-sucking and treatment incidences of diarrhoea, respiratory diseases and umbilical infections. This on-farm study comprising Simmental organic dairy herds partly confirms existing knowledge on preventive measures (e.g. homogenous age groups, long duration of sucking) to be applicable on-farm. Furthermore, it provides evidence that grouping after the first week of life is possible without an increased risk for cross-sucking. The perceived risk of cross-sucking leading to infections could not be proven, as most likely other factors are more relevant.},

	abstract = {The importance of drinking water for production and animal welfare is widely recognized, but surveys and animal welfare assessment schemes suggest that many dairy calves and dairy cows do not have sufficient access. Limit milk-fed calves drink more water than calves fed milk ad libitum, but ad libitum milk-fed calves also require access to drinking water, as milk does not meet the animal's requirement for water. At hot ambient temperatures and when calves are sick, access to water is especially important and should be provided at all times. Many young calves do not have access to water throughout 24 h, and whether healthy young calves require free access to water at all times, or from which age, is not clear and requires further study. Dairy cow free water intake (FWI) is largely determined by milk yield, and high-yielding dairy cows may drink up 100 L of water per day. Dry matter, crude protein, and salt content of feed, as well as ambient temperature, have considerable effects on dairy cow water intake. Deprivation of water affects meal patterning for the cow, as well as increased subsequent rate of drinking and compensatory water intake. Although dairy cow ad libitum water intake may exceed the water provision necessary to maintain production, offering water for ad libitum intake may be necessary to safe guard animal welfare. Cattle are suction drinkers that prefer to drink from large open water surfaces, and Holstein dairy cows can drink at a rate of up to 24 L/min. Research on the effect of design and placement of water troughs for indoor-housed dairy cows on their drinking behavior and water intake is limited. Access to a water source at pasture increases the time cows spend there, and access to shade reduces water requirements during periods of warm weather. In both indoor and pastured cattle, there is a lack of knowledge about the effect of stocking of water troughs on competition, drinking behavior, and intake in dairy cows. Studies on the effect of available water trough length and placement, and of the number of cows being able to drink from the same trough of a given dimension, are needed to evaluate current recommendations.},

	abstract = {The complexity experienced in early life can affect trait development of individuals, including sociability and fearfulness. The modern dairy calf’s rearing environment often lacks environmental and social complexity. This study examined the effects of early-life, non-maternal adult contact and access to a physically complex environment on the responses of dairy heifers to several stressors, including restraint, social isolation, and novelty at 18 months of age. From the age of 2–13 weeks, 60 dairy heifers (Bos taurus) were reared according to one of three treatments applied to 20 calves each: (1) Hand-reared at pasture in groups of ten, with three unrelated dry cows (+S); (2) Hand-reared at pasture in groups of ten (–S); or (3) Hand-reared in sheds in groups of 10–12 as a commercial control (CC). At 13 weeks, all treatment groups were mixed and managed at pasture as a single herd. At 18 months, the responses of 50 heifers to restraint in a crush, social isolation and a novel object were observed (+S = 16, –S = 17, CC = 17). Treatment did not influence responses to restraint or social isolation, but influenced some indicators of fearfulness during exposure to a novel object. Six +S heifers interacted with the novel object compared to 0 –S and one CC, and CC heifers spent around 50\% more time in vigilance than +S or –S heifers. Dairy heifers provided with early-life social enrichment in the form of non-maternal adult contact may have reduced fear of novelty. The implications for lifelong ability to adapt to novel situations, such as entry into the milking herd, should be assessed.},

	abstract = {Calfhood diseases have a major impact on the economic viability of cattle operations. A three part review series has been developed focusing on calf health from birth to weaning. In this paper, the last of the three part series, we review disease prevention and management with particular reference to pneumonia, focusing primarily on the pre-weaned calf. Pneumonia in recently weaned suckler calves is also considered, where the key risk factors are related to the time of weaning. Weaning of the suckler calf is often combined with additional stressors including a change in nutrition, environmental change, transport and painful husbandry procedures (castration, dehorning). The reduction of the cumulative effects of these multiple stressors around the time of weaning together with vaccination programmes (preconditioning) can reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality in the feedlot. In most studies, calves housed individually and calves housed outdoors with shelter, are associated with decreased risk of disease. Even though it poses greater management challenges, successful group housing of calves is possible. Special emphasis should be given to equal age groups and to keeping groups stable once they are formed. The management of pneumonia in calves is reliant on a sound understanding of aetiology, relevant risk factors, and of effective approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Early signs of pneumonia include increased respiratory rate and fever, followed by depression. The single most important factor determining the success of therapy in calves with pneumonia is early onset of treatment, and subsequent adequate duration of treatment. The efficacy and economical viability of vaccination against respiratory disease in calves remains unclear.},

Further, no information exists on the effects on calf behavior and performance of different water delivery systems during these stages. Therefore, the objectives of this study were first, to examine the water intake of calves fed acidified milk replacer ad libitum during the milk-feeding and weaning stages, and second, to determine whether the method of water delivery affected water and feed intake and growth during these periods or oral behavior during weaning. To evaluate this, we registered feed and water intake, growth, and oral behaviors of 24 dairy calves before and after abrupt weaning from a 7-wk ad libitum acidified milk replacer feeding regimen. Two water sources (open bucket and nipple) were compared. During the 7-wk milk-feeding period, the calves drank, on average, 12.9±0.7 L/d of acidified milk replacer but very little water. However, after abrupt removal of milk, the 2-mo-old calves rapidly increased their water intake. Moreover, no differences in water intake between the 2 water sources were noted either before or after abrupt weaning. Calves were observed to have some difficulties in using the water nipple. Calves provided water through the nipples consumed less water at each drinking bout but visited the water nipple more frequently compared with calves provided access to water from the bucket. We observed no differences in all other behaviors observed. Overall, the calves rapidly increased their feed intake, rumination time, frequency of cross-sucking, and vocalization after weaning. In conclusion, despite the calves’ consuming very little water when provided ad libitum access to acidified milk replacer, they dramatically increased their water consumption after abrupt weaning from milk. Calves did experience some difficulties in using the water nipples.},

	abstract = {Adult dairy cattle show a preference for outdoor spaces during summer nights, but little is known about such preferences for dairy calves. Our aim was to determine the preferences of dairy calves for outdoor access during their first 11 wk of age in summer conditions. Calves were paired (n = 10) at 7 d of age and placed in one of 10 pens (7.32 × 2.44 m, deep bedded with bark mulch), each with equally sized outdoor and indoor areas. All feed was provided indoors; calves had ad libitum access to water, hay and concentrate. During the preweaning period, from 5 to 29 d of age, calves were offered 12 L/d of milk divided into 2 feedings. Calves were weaned stepwise, with milk gradually reduced by 1 L/d from d 30 to 35 of age. Calves were fed 6 L/d from 35 to 51 d of age, then milk was again reduced by 1 L/d so that calves were completely weaned by 56 d of age. Calves remained in the trial until, on average (± SD), 72 ± 2 d of age. Pens were continuously video recorded, and behaviors were scored 3 d/wk using 5-min scan samples. Four observers scored whether calves were inside, outside, lying, standing, in the sun or shade (interobserver reliability = 0.97). Sun and shade could not always be detected, so a proportion was calculated as the amount of time in the sun or shade divided by the total time sun or shade was visible. Calves spent approximately one-third of their time outside throughout the experiment, and time spent outside was affected by several factors. Pairs of calves spent less time outside as the amount of rain increased. During the first 6 wk of age, time spent outside increased, but time spent outside decreased between wk 6 and 7, and remained around 200 min/d from wk 7 to 11. Calves with the highest average daily gain and calves that were approximately 50\% white appeared to spend more time outdoors. When outside, calves spent similar amounts of time in the sun and shade during the first 8 wk, but after weaning they appeared to spend more time in the shade. When calves were outside they appeared to spend a greater proportion of their time standing than when they were indoors during the first 4 wk. These results indicate that, when given the option in the summer, calves make use of an outdoor space, but this appears to vary with weather, calf age, average daily gain, and coat color.},

	abstract = {The provision of forage to pre-weaned calves has been continuously researched and discussed by scientists, though results associated with calf growth and performance have remained inconsistent. Multiple factors, including forage type, intake level, physical form, and feeding method of both solid and liquid feed, can influence the outcomes of forage inclusion on calf performance. In the current review, we summarized published literature in order to get a comprehensive understanding of how early forage inclusion in diets affects calf growth performance, rumen fermentation, microbiota composition, and the development of feeding behavior. A small amount of good quality forage, such as alfalfa hay, supplemented in the diet, is likely to improve calf feed intake and growth rate. Provision of forage early in life may result in greater chewing (eating and ruminating) activity. Moreover, forage supplementation decreases non-nutritive oral and feed sorting behaviors, which can help to maintain rumen fluid pH and increase the number of cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen. This review argues that forage provision early in life has the potential to affect the rumen environment and the development of feeding behavior in dairy calves. Continued research is required to further understand the long-term effects of forage supplementation in pre-weaned calves, because animal-related factors, such as feed selection and sorting, early in life may persist until later in adult life.},
