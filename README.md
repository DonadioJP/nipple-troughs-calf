# Nipple Water Troughs Reduces Cross-Sucking in Dairy Calves  

![Example Visualization](figures/Calves_water.png)

## 📜 Study Overview  
This project evaluated how nipple water troughs influence cross-sucking behavior and growth in group-housed dairy calves raised on pasture.

Key findings include:  
- **42% reduction in cross-sucking** in calves with nipple access vs. open troughs (*p* = 0.003).  
- **No negative impact on growth** (weaning weights: *p* = 0.788).  
- Behavioral shifts: Longer water trough visits and nighttime water intake in nipple-equipped calves.  

**Manuscript Status**: Under review at *Applied Animal Behaviour Science*.
